# WEB3000-Agile

  This course will provide the student with an introduction to Agile, and improve the practice of pair programming. Git will also be covered in depth. The first week  will involve agile practices and concepts, in addition to git workflow mastery. The rest of the course will have the students working on pair programming through various JS challenges. The goal is to teach them the fundamental skills needed to become software engineers while sharpening their JS skills. 

## Summary

1. Agile principles, scrum, decision making, BDD, TDD
2. Git Staging and Remotes
3. Cloning and Branching
4. Collaboration basics
5. Branching
6. Rebasing, merging and resolving conflicts
7. Pair programming practice as a cornerstone to Agile practices.

## Homework
1. Answer the follow up questions from the following lectures:

  - [Agile vs P&D](https://youtu.be/CbLKWRp1TGo)
  - [Size and Scrum](https://youtu.be/JFZi4bGGJOk)
  - [Pair Programming](https://youtu.be/JbDR58lsIl0)
  - [BDD and User Stories](https://youtu.be/duUIq-KTLq8)
  - [Agile Cost Estimation](https://youtu.be/8ZoytqaIbss)
  </br>

2. Complete [Treehouse Unit Testing ](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/javascript-unit-testing)
3. Complete [Code School Try Git](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git)
4. Find tutorials or read documentation to complete assigned user stories.

### Day One: Agile Fundamentals
  1. Introduction to Agile principles:Go through a mock iteration from user story, to passing test, to deployment. Have the student do their own.
  2. Introduction to git and version control systems

### Day Two: Git Workflows I
  1. Git Staging and Remotes: Have the student modify and revert changes on their own repo in the staging life-cycle.
  2. Git Clone and Branching: Find a open source project of interest. Read the documentation, clone and implement and implement a local version.  Have student create a branch, modify, make changes and then merge back into master, then delete the branch locally and remotely.
  3. Collaboration Fundamentals: Have students all try to create branches on each others master and then merge each others branches. Manage remote and local branches.

### Day Three: Git Workflows II  
  1. Branching and tagging: More on managing branches as well as versioning through tags.
  2. Rebasing: Edit your commits through the use of interactive rebase
  3. Stashing: The 'undo' of git. Manage multiple stages with stash.

### Day Four: Pair Programming, Javascript deep dive 
1. Introduction to pair programming.
2. Pair programming practice.
3. JavaScript - Thread, execution and Call stack. The student will walk through Javascript execution on the whiteboard with the professor. Additionally, each student should be able to "execute code" on their own on the whiteboard. The goal is to create a deeper understanding of how JS works under the cover, and begin the process of improving the students technical communication, problem solving ability with code. 
4. Student challenges. Once completed, the students should be able to walk through the execution of the challenges on the whiteboard. The professor should test this at random with the students.

### Day 5: 
1. Callbacks and Higher order functions
2. Student challenges: pair programming
3. Review as with 3 and 4 in Day 4.

### Day 6:
1. Continue Challenges from Day 5.
2. Closure lecture, and technical explanation with walkthrough
3. Closure challenges: pair programming
4. Review as with 3 and 4 in day 4.

### Day 7:
1. Continue challenges from Day 6.
2. Aynchronous Javascript lecture and technical explanation with walkthrough
3. Student challenges: pair programming
4. Review as with 3 and 4 in Day 4.

## Todo:
- [ ] Have student just push her/his branch independent of master state
