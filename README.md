# WEB3000-Agile

  This course will involve finding a product we can build for the FVI staff. The first week  will involve agile practices and concepts, in addition to git workflow mastery  The last two weeks will entail executing a simple project. This course will have a strong focus on learning to adapt quickly to changing customer needs. If there is student demand, as well as aptitude, an advanced framework or mobile platform such as React or Ionic will be chosen. This course is modeled after [BerkelyX's Agile Course](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:BerkeleyX+CS169.1x+3T2015SP/c)

3. Git Staging and Remotes
4. Cloning and Branching
5. Collaboration basics
6. Branching
7. Rebasing, merging and resolving conflicts
8. Learning how to complete chores in order to complete a user story.

## Homework

  - [Agile Cost Estimation](https://youtu.be/8ZoytqaIbss)
  </br>
2. Complete [Treehouse Unit Testing ](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/javascript-unit-testing)
3. Complete [Code School Try Git](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git)
4. Find tutorials or read documentation to complete assigned user stories.

### Day One: Agile Fundamentals
  1. Introduction to Agile principles:Go through a mock iteration from user story, to passing test, to deployment. Have the student implement their own.
  2. Explain all the tooling in the starter kit. Reiterate on npm, package.json and explain weback or browserify.
  3. Introduction to git and version control systems

### Day Two: Git Workflows I
  1. Git Staging and Remotes: Have the student modify and revert changes on their own repo in the staging life-cycle.
  2. Git Clone and Branching: Find a open source project of interest. Read the documentation, clone and implement and implement a local version.  Have student create a branch, modify, make changes and then merge back into master, then delete the branch locally and remotely.
  3. Collaboration Fundamentals: Have students all try to create branches on each others master and then merge each others branches. Manage remote and local branches.

### Day Three: Git Workflows II  
  1. Branching and tagging: More on managing branches as well as versioning through tags.
  2. Rebasing: Edit your commits through the use of interactive rebase
  3. Stashing: The 'undo' of git. Manage multiple stages with stash.

### Day Four: Javascript Unit-Testing  
1. Introduction to Unit-Testing: This stage covers different kinds of automated testing, especially “unit testing”. You'll learn what a unit test is, when you should write them, and why having unit tests is so useful.
2. BDD: The real power of unit tests is when you use them to help you write code from the start. In this stage, you'll use Mocha.js and Chai to write tests about how your functions should behave as an outline for your actual code.
3. Optimizing Tests: Just like your application code, you should keep your tests DRY and tidy. This stage explores handy ways to avoid repeating code. You'll also expand your tests to build your confidence in the code you've written so far.
4. Outputing to Stakeholders: In this stage, you'll learn how Mocha can output your test results in a browser. You'll also learn testing features that simplify testing in bigger projects.
5. Explain Project and Assign User Stories

### Day 5+:  Complete User Stories...

## Todo:
- [ ] Have student just push her/his branch independent of master state
