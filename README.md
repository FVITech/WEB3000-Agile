# WEB2040-Agile

  This course will involve finding a product we can build for the FVI staff. The week three the course will involve agile practices and concepts and git workflow mastery  The last two weeks will entail executing a simple project. This course will have a strong focus on learning to adapt quickly to changing customer needs. If there is student demand as well as aptitude a advanced framework or mobile platform such as React or Ionic will be chosen. This course is modeled after [BerkelyX's Agile Course](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:BerkeleyX+CS169.1x+3T2015SP/c)
